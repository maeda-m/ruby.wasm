# We build ./vendor/cache/js-{version}.gem just before evaluating this Gemfile
# so that Bundler builds extensions even from the local gem. (gem extensions
# from "path:" gems are not built by Bundler.)
# Thus even we specify version of "js" gem here, it should always installed
# from the ./vendor/cache/js-{version}.gem, not from rubygems.org. To achieve this,
# we always use non-exist version during development.
